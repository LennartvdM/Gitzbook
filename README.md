## What is Gitzbook?

Gitzbook is a developer-first documentation platform that treats your docs like code. Write in Markdown, version with Git, and deploy anywhere. Gitzbook automatically generates beautiful, searchable documentation sites from your repository.

## Features

- **Git-native** -- Your docs live in your repo. Branch, merge, and review docs just like code.
- **Instant Search** -- Full-text search powered by FlexSearch with typo tolerance.
- **Live Preview** -- Hot-reloading dev server with sub-50ms refresh times.
- **Theming** -- Built-in dark/light mode with full CSS custom property support.
- **Plugins** -- Extend functionality with the plugin API (Mermaid, KaTeX, OpenAPI, and more).
- **i18n** -- First-class internationalization with automatic language detection.
- **SSG & SSR** -- Static site generation by default, with optional server-side rendering.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g gitzbook

# Initialize in your project
gitzbook init

# Start the dev server
gitzbook dev
```

Your docs site is now running at `http://localhost:4280`.

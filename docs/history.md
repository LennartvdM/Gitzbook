# History of Goblins

## The Age of Burrows (Prehistory - 3000 BE)

The earliest evidence of goblin civilization dates back roughly twelve thousand years, found in the Riddleback Caverns of the Northern Spine mountains. Crude wall carvings depict small figures with pointed ears engaged in what archaeologists believe is either a religious ceremony or a very aggressive game of keep-away.

During this period, goblins were primarily subterranean, living in loosely connected burrow networks. They had not yet developed metalwork, relying instead on sharpened bone tools and an impressive array of improvised traps.

## The Fungal Enlightenment (3000 - 1500 BE)

The pivotal moment in goblin history was the domestication of the Great Cavern Mushroom (*Fungus magnificens*). This allowed goblins to transition from nomadic scavenging to settled agriculture — or more accurately, settled fungikulture.

With reliable food came population growth, and with population growth came the first true goblin cities. The underground metropolis of Skagrot, believed to have housed over fifty thousand goblins at its peak, featured:

- Multi-level residential warrens
- Mushroom farms spanning entire cavern floors
- A rudimentary sewage system (revolutionary for the era)
- The first known goblin library (mostly recipes)

## The Surface Wars (1500 - 800 BE)

As goblin populations expanded, clans began competing for access to surface resources. This period saw the first organized goblin armies and the development of goblin metallurgy — initially bronze, then a unique alloy they call *grak-tin*, which is lighter than steel but has an unfortunate tendency to turn green.

The Surface Wars were not a single conflict but a rolling series of territorial disputes, alliances, betrayals, and elaborate ambushes spanning seven centuries. Notable events include:

- **The Battle of Fern Hollow** (1203 BE) — The first recorded use of goblin siege engineering
- **The Pact of Twelve Warrens** (987 BE) — The first inter-clan treaty, establishing shared surface foraging rights
- **The Great Betrayal of Clan Nikkrit** (801 BE) — Which ended the wars and is still a sore subject

## The Age of Tunnels (800 BE - 400 CE)

Following the Surface Wars, goblins entered a period of unprecedented engineering achievement. The Great Tunnel Network — connecting major settlements across three continents — was begun in 612 BE and is still being expanded today.

This era also saw the formalization of goblin written language, the establishment of the Tinker Guilds, and the invention of the goblin pressure clock, which keeps time by measuring the drip rate of cave condensation.

## Modern Era (400 CE - Present)

The modern era is defined by increased contact with surface-dwelling peoples. Goblins have established trade relationships (often reluctantly) and have become valued, if eccentric, members of the broader world economy.

Key modern developments:

- Goblin-made clockwork mechanisms are prized by collectors
- The Treaty of Copperdeep (1847 CE) established formal diplomatic relations with human nations
- Goblin engineers contributed to several major infrastructure projects (usually the parts that go underground)
- The founding of the Goblin Technical Institute in 1923 CE

# Cuisine & Foraging

Goblin cuisine is an acquired taste — and most non-goblins never acquire it. Built around the central pillar of fungi, supplemented by insects, cave fish, and whatever surface ingredients can be obtained through trade or "creative acquisition," goblin cooking is inventive, nutritious, and deeply alarming to the uninitiated.

## The Mushroom Pantry

Goblins cultivate over three hundred varieties of mushroom, each with specific culinary applications:

| Mushroom | Use | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| Pale Cap | Staple food, like goblin bread | Bland but filling |
| Ember Shroom | Spice (extremely hot) | Handle with gloves |
| Glowbell | Garnish and lighting | Bioluminescent |
| Deeproot Truffle | Luxury ingredient | Worth more than gold by weight |
| Stonecap | Ground into flour | Takes 3 days to grind |
| Dreamdrift | Fermented into alcohol | Mildly hallucinogenic |

## Signature Dishes

### Skagrot Stew

The national dish of goblinkind. Every clan has their own recipe, and arguments about the "correct" version have caused at least three documented wars.

The basic recipe:

1. Soak dried pale caps overnight in cave water
2. Saut&eacute; cave crickets in rendered beetle fat
3. Add chopped stonecap, ember shroom flakes, and root vegetables
4. Simmer for six hours in a stone pot
5. Season with mineral salt and powdered glowbell
6. Serve in a hollowed-out mushroom cap

### Crunchbread

A flatbread made from stonecap flour mixed with ground beetle carapace. It is exactly as crunchy as the name implies. Crunchbread keeps for months and is the standard travel food for goblin traders and scouts.

### Bogwater Tea

A specialty of bog goblins, made by steeping specific moss and fungi in naturally carbonated spring water. It's fizzy, slightly bitter, and genuinely refreshing. This is one of the few goblin foods that has found an audience among non-goblins.

## Foraging Practices

Goblin foragers follow strict sustainable harvesting rules passed down through generations:

- **The Rule of Thirds**: Never harvest more than a third of any wild mushroom colony
- **The Rotation Calendar**: Different foraging zones are harvested on a three-year cycle
- **The Spore Debt**: For every mushroom harvested, a forager scatters spores of cultivated varieties

These practices have kept goblin territories ecologically stable for thousands of years, a fact that surface ecologists have only recently begun to appreciate.

## Fermented Goods

Goblins are master fermenters. Their most notable fermented products include:

- **Grak-ale**: Made from dreamdrift mushrooms, this is the standard goblin alcoholic beverage. It has a purple tinge and tastes like earthy honey with a kick.
- **Tunnel Sauce**: A fermented mushroom paste used as a universal condiment. Comparable to soy sauce but with a more complex fungal flavor.
- **Caveshine**: A distilled spirit made from multiple mushroom varieties. Extremely potent. Has been known to dissolve certain metals.

## Dining Etiquette

Goblin meals are communal affairs with specific rules:

1. The eldest eats first (a single bite to confirm the food isn't poisoned)
2. Food is served in a central pot; everyone shares
3. Complimenting the cook is mandatory; failure to do so is a minor insult
4. Asking for the recipe is a major insult (recipes are clan secrets)
5. Belching after the meal is a compliment
6. Leaving food uneaten is unacceptable — portions are carefully calculated

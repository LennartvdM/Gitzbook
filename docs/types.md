# Types of Goblins

While all goblins share a common ancestry, thousands of years of adaptation to different environments have produced several distinct subspecies. The classification system below follows the Ashwick-Bramble taxonomy adopted by the Royal Cryptozoological Society in 1956.

## Cave Goblins (*Goblinus subterraneus*)

The most common and "classical" goblin. Cave goblins have:

- Pale green to grey skin
- Excellent darkvision
- Heights averaging 1.0 meters
- An instinctive understanding of load-bearing structures

Cave goblins make up roughly 60% of the total goblin population. They are the builders of the Great Tunnel Network and the keepers of the oldest goblin traditions.

Identifying Features:
- Large, reflective eyes (adapted for low light)
- Slightly webbed fingers (from generations of cave-pool fishing)
- Distinctive musty odor (considered attractive among goblins)
```

## Forest Goblins (*Goblinus silvaticus*)

Forest goblins diverged from the main population roughly four thousand years ago when several clans chose to remain on the surface permanently. They tend to be:

- Darker green with mottled brown patches
- Slightly taller (averaging 1.1 meters)
- Exceptional climbers
- Masters of camouflage and herbalism

Forest goblins live in elaborate treehouse communities connected by rope bridges and ziplines. They are the world's foremost experts on non-magical poisons, a fact that makes negotiations with them notably tense.

## Bog Goblins (*Goblinus paludis*)

Bog goblins inhabit wetlands and marshes. They are considered eccentric even by goblin standards. Characteristics include:

- Blue-green skin with a slightly slimy texture
- Partially amphibious (can hold breath for up to 20 minutes)
- Heights averaging 0.9 meters
- A philosophical disposition that unnerves other goblins

Bog goblins are the only goblin subspecies known to practice meditation. Their settlements are built on stilts above the waterline, and they cultivate rare aquatic mushrooms found nowhere else.

## Mountain Goblins (*Goblinus alpinus*)

The hardiest goblin subspecies, mountain goblins inhabit high-altitude cave systems and rocky outcrops. They feature:

- Dark grey to charcoal skin
- Stocky builds with dense muscle
- Heights averaging 1.0 meters but significantly broader
- Resistance to cold and thin air

Mountain goblins are renowned miners and gemcutters. Their settlements sit at elevations that would cause altitude sickness in most other species. They have a reputation for being the most direct and least cunning of the goblin subspecies, which among goblins is considered a mild insult.

## Desert Goblins (*Goblinus aridus*)

The rarest subspecies, desert goblins inhabit deep sandstone cave systems beneath arid regions. They are notable for:

- Sandy yellow to orange skin
- The smallest average size (0.85 meters)
- Extraordinary water conservation biology
- A nomadic lifestyle, even underground

Desert goblins travel between oasis cave systems, following underground water sources. They are the only goblin subspecies that domesticates animals — specifically, the giant sand beetle, which they ride and use as pack animals.

## Hybrid Populations

Where goblin subspecies territories overlap, hybrid populations exist. The most common hybrid is the Cave-Forest goblin, found at the edges of major forests where cave systems are accessible. Hybrids tend to combine traits from both parent subspecies and are generally accepted by either community, though they are sometimes teased for being "confused about which way is up."

# The Goblin Field Guide

Welcome to the most comprehensive reference on goblinkind ever assembled. This guide is the product of decades of fieldwork by the Royal Cryptozoological Society, compiled from firsthand observations, recovered goblin manuscripts, and only a moderate number of poisoned darts to the neck.

## Why Study Goblins?

Goblins are among the most misunderstood creatures in the known world. Often dismissed as mere pests, they possess a rich culture, a surprisingly advanced understanding of mechanical engineering, and a culinary tradition that — while not for the faint of stomach — is genuinely innovative.

This field guide covers everything from goblin social structures and battlefield tactics to their peculiar relationship with mushrooms and their legendary tunnel networks.

## A Word of Caution

If you are reading this in the field, please be aware that goblins can smell parchment from up to forty meters away. They consider the act of writing about them without permission to be a declaration of war. The Society accepts no liability for any consequences arising from the use of this guide in goblin-adjacent territories.

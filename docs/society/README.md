# Goblin Society

Goblin society is complex, layered, and — to outsiders — frequently baffling. What appears chaotic on the surface is in fact governed by an intricate web of social obligations, clan loyalties, and unwritten rules that every goblin absorbs from birth.

## Overview

Goblin communities are organized around the **clan** — an extended family unit typically numbering between fifty and three hundred individuals. Clans occupy specific territories (usually a section of tunnel network or a defined surface area) and are largely self-governing.

Key features of goblin society:

- **Clan-based identity**: A goblin's clan is their primary social unit, more important than settlement, profession, or personal preference
- **Meritocratic leadership**: Leaders earn their position through demonstrated competence, not inheritance
- **Collective decision-making**: Major decisions require consensus among clan elders
- **Long memories**: Goblins keep meticulous records of debts, favors, and grudges — some dating back centuries

## Values

The core values of goblin culture, roughly in order of importance:

1. **Loyalty to clan** — Betraying your clan is the worst crime in goblin society
2. **Resourcefulness** — Solving problems with what you have is more respected than having the best tools
3. **Persistence** — Giving up is shameful; failing after a genuine effort is not
4. **Fairness in trade** — Goblins drive hard bargains but despise cheating
5. **Respect for craft** — Skilled work of any kind is honored

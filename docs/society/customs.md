# Customs & Traditions

Goblin customs are numerous, specific, and often incomprehensible to outsiders. What follows is an overview of the most important and widely observed traditions across goblin clans.

## The Naming Ceremony

Goblin younglings are not named at birth. Instead, they receive a temporary "milk-name" used only within the immediate family. At age three, a formal naming ceremony is held where the youngling receives their true name.

The naming process:
1. The Greybeard recites the clan's lineage
2. The youngling's parents propose a name (usually honoring a deceased relative or notable achievement)
3. The Council of Notables votes to accept or suggest modifications
4. The youngling's name is inscribed in the clan register

Goblin names typically have two parts: a personal name and a clan name (e.g., **Grik Copperteeth**, **Nazza Deeproot**). Some goblins earn a third "deed-name" through exceptional accomplishment.

## The Craft Trial

When a goblin reaches age twelve, they undergo the Craft Trial — a period of apprenticeship and testing that determines their role in the clan. The trial lasts one year, during which the youngling rotates through different crafts and duties.

At the end of the year, the youngling chooses a craft (subject to the availability of masters willing to take them on). This choice is not permanent — goblins can change crafts later in life — but the initial choice carries social weight.

## The Deepwalk

A coming-of-age ritual performed at age sixteen. The young goblin must navigate alone through an unfamiliar section of tunnel, relying only on their training and instincts. The route is chosen by the Council and varies in difficulty based on the goblin's intended craft:

- Future engineers must navigate past structural hazards
- Future foragers must identify and collect specific fungi
- Future warriors must detect and disarm three traps

Failure is not shameful — the Deepwalk can be attempted again. Roughly 80% of goblins pass on their first try.

## Seasonal Festivals

### The Spore Festival (Spring equivalent)

Celebrates the annual mushroom propagation cycle. Features:
- Communal planting of new mushroom colonies
- Competitions for the largest/rarest mushroom find
- A feast built around the previous year's preserved harvest
- The "Spore Dance," which is exactly as undignified as it sounds

### The Long Dark (Winter solstice)

The one day per year when goblins extinguish all artificial light in their settlements and sit in complete darkness for several hours. This tradition commemorates the Age of Burrows, when goblins had no light sources.

During the Long Dark:
- Elders tell stories from clan history
- New grudges from the past year may be formally declared
- Old grudges may be formally resolved
- The lights are re-lit by the youngest member of the clan, symbolizing continuity

### Hammerfest (Autumn equivalent)

A celebration of engineering and craft. Tinker Guilds present new inventions, apprentices display their progress, and the clan collectively maintains and repairs shared infrastructure. Hammerfest typically lasts three days and includes competitive events:

- Speed-forging (make a useful tool in under an hour)
- Trap-building (design and construct the most creative trap)
- The "Rube" contest (build the most unnecessarily complex device to perform a simple task)

## Greeting Customs

Goblin greetings vary by relationship:

- **Clan members**: A nod and a tap on the left shoulder
- **Allied clan members**: A nod and an open-palmed hand gesture (showing no weapon)
- **Strangers**: Direct eye contact and a verbal statement of name, clan, and intent
- **Enemies**: Traditionally, a thrown rock — though modern goblins consider this uncouth

## Death Rites

Goblins return their dead to the earth through burial in dedicated tunnel alcoves. The body is wrapped in mushroom-cloth and placed in a carved niche, which is then sealed with stone.

The Greybeard recites the deceased's life achievements and resolves any outstanding grudge-ledger entries (debts of the dead pass to their closest kin). A small feast follows, using the deceased's favorite recipe — which is the one time a clan will share a recipe with outsiders if the deceased had non-goblin friends.

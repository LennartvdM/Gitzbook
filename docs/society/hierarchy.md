# Social Hierarchy

Goblin social hierarchy is meritocratic with a strong emphasis on age and experience. Unlike many surface cultures, goblin leadership is neither hereditary nor permanent — leaders serve at the pleasure of their community and can be replaced through formal challenge.

## Clan Structure

Every clan has the following roles:

### The Greybeard (or Greymother)

The eldest active member of the clan. The Greybeard serves as the primary decision-maker, mediator, and keeper of clan history. Despite the name, this role is not gender-specific — "Greybeard" is used regardless, though some clans prefer "Greymother" or the gender-neutral "Greywise."

**Responsibilities:**
- Final authority on disputes within the clan
- Keeper of the clan's oral history and grudge-ledger
- Representative at inter-clan councils
- First to taste communal meals (a safety role, not just an honor)

### The Council of Notables

A group of 5-12 experienced goblins who advise the Greybeard. Membership is earned through recognized expertise in a critical field:

- A master engineer (Tinkerer rank or higher)
- A senior forager or farmer
- A war-captain (even in peacetime)
- A healer
- A trader with external contacts
- Additional specialists as needed

The Council votes on matters the Greybeard brings to them. A two-thirds majority is required for major decisions (territory disputes, alliance treaties, war declarations).

### Crafters and Specialists

The skilled middle class of goblin society. This includes engineers, fungimancers, healers, scribes, and artisans. Crafters are respected in proportion to their skill and are largely left to govern their own professional affairs through the guild system.

### General Clan Members

The majority of any clan. These goblins handle day-to-day tasks — farming, foraging, construction, patrol, and maintenance. They participate in clan decisions through public assemblies where major proposals are debated.

### Younglings

Goblins under the age of twelve are considered younglings and have no formal social standing. They are, however, universally protected — harming a youngling is one of the few offenses punishable by permanent exile in goblin law.

## Status and Prestige

Status among goblins is determined by:

1. **Skill** — What you can do matters more than who you are
2. **Age** — Experience is valued; elders are respected by default
3. **Contribution** — What have you done for the clan lately?
4. **Reputation** — Your word is your bond; breaking it destroys your standing
5. **Grudge balance** — Owing too many debts or carrying too many unresolved grudges lowers your social standing

## The Grudge-Ledger

Every clan maintains a **grudge-ledger** — a meticulous record of debts, favors, insults, and their resolutions. The grudge-ledger is both a legal document and a social scoreboard. Entries can date back generations.

A goblin with a "clean ledger" (no outstanding debts or grudges) is considered exceptionally honorable. A goblin with a "heavy ledger" may find their social standing reduced until they settle their accounts.

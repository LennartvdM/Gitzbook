# Language & Communication

Goblins communicate through a rich combination of spoken language, written script, and non-verbal signals. Their linguistic traditions reflect thousands of years of underground living, where sound, light, and silence all carry meaning.

## Gob'zhar: The Goblin Tongue

Gob'zhar is the primary language of goblinkind. It is a guttural, rapid language with a large vocabulary for underground concepts (there are fourteen different words for "darkness" and twenty-three for "mushroom") but relatively few words for sky, weather, or open spaces.

### Key Features

- **Tonal elements**: The same syllable spoken at different pitches can mean different things. The word "grak" means "stone" at a low pitch, "stubborn" at mid pitch, and "grandmother" at high pitch (goblins find the overlap between these meanings hilarious)
- **Compound words**: Gob'zhar builds complex concepts by chaining root words. "Tunnelbore" is *grak-thek-rri* — literally "stone-eat-machine"
- **No future tense**: Gob'zhar has a rich past tense (with separate forms for "witnessed," "told to me," and "found in records") but no true future tense. Future events are expressed as intentions or possibilities, never certainties. Linguists believe this reflects the goblin cultural attitude that promises about the future are inherently unreliable.

### Common Phrases

| Gob'zhar | Translation | Literal Meaning |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| *Thek-ga* | Hello | "I see you" |
| *Nok-thek* | Goodbye | "Into the dark" |
| *Grak-zul* | Thank you | "Stone-debt" (I owe you) |
| *Nik-nik* | Warning/danger | "Sharp-sharp" |
| *Brol-thuum* | Well done | "Good stubbornness" |
| *Kezzit* | Outsider/surface-dweller | "Sky-touched" (mildly derogatory) |

## Written Language

Goblin script evolved from the wall carvings of the Age of Burrows. It is angular and designed to be carved into stone — curved letters are rare because curves are hard to chisel in granite.

The script has 31 characters:
- 18 consonants
- 6 vowels
- 7 combination glyphs (common syllables given their own symbol for speed)

Goblin writing reads left-to-right and top-to-bottom, same as Common script. However, goblin documents often include marginal notations that spiral around the main text — additional context, cross-references, or editorial comments that the writer felt were important but not central.

## Tunnel Signals

In the deep tunnels where sound echoes unpredictably and light is scarce, goblins use a system of non-verbal communication:

### Tap-Code

A series of rhythmic taps on stone walls, audible through rock for considerable distances:

- **Single tap**: "I am here"
- **Double tap**: "Acknowledged"
- **Three rapid taps**: "Come here"
- **Continuous tapping**: "Danger — do not approach"
- **Rhythmic pattern (shave-and-a-haircut)**: "All clear, situation normal"

### Light Signals

Using glowjars or bioluminescent fungi:

- **Steady light**: "Safe passage"
- **Flickering**: "Caution — proceed carefully"
- **Rapid flashing**: "Emergency"
- **No light in a normally lit area**: "Trap or ambush — avoid"

### Scent Markers

Goblins have a keen sense of smell and use scent markers (made from specific mushroom extracts) to convey information:

- Territorial boundaries
- Safe water sources
- Poisonous areas
- Trail markers in unmapped tunnels

Surface-dwellers are generally unable to detect these markers, which suits goblins just fine.

## Trade Common

Most goblins who interact with surface-dwellers speak a version of Common, though with distinctive features:

- Heavy use of mining and engineering metaphors
- A tendency to avoid future-tense constructions (influenced by Gob'zhar)
- Frequent use of the phrase "fair trade?" as a conversation-ending request for agreement
- A notable accent that makes "th" sounds difficult (rendered as "z" or "d")

# Goblin Engineering

If there is one field where goblins have earned universal respect — however grudging — it is engineering. Goblin-built mechanisms, tunnels, and structures routinely outperform their surface-world equivalents, often using a fraction of the materials. The catch is that goblin engineering follows its own logic, and attempting to repair or modify goblin-built devices without understanding that logic usually ends badly.

## Core Principles

Goblin engineering is guided by three principles that every apprentice learns on their first day:

1. **If it works, it's not stupid.** Goblin devices often look haphazard to outside observers. They are not. Every bent pipe, asymmetric gear, and seemingly random lever serves a purpose.

2. **Waste nothing.** Goblin engineers use every scrap of material. A single ingot of metal might be distributed across dozens of components in different machines.

3. **Build for the next thousand years.** Goblin infrastructure is designed to last. The oldest functioning goblin mechanisms are over three thousand years old.

## The Tinker Guilds

All formal goblin engineering is organized through the Tinker Guilds, a network of professional organizations that control training, standards, and the distribution of engineering knowledge.

Guild ranks:

```
Fumbler     → Apprentice (years 1-3)
Fiddler     → Journeyman (years 4-8)
Tinkerer    → Full engineer (years 9+)
Grand Cog   → Master engineer (by peer election)
Gearmother/
Gearfather  → Guild leader (one per regional guild)
```

Becoming a full Tinkerer requires completing a "Masterwork" — a device or structure that demonstrates original thinking and technical mastery. These masterworks are displayed in Guild Halls and some are still in active use centuries later.

## Notable Engineering Achievements

### The Great Tunnel Network

Spanning three continents and totaling an estimated 40,000 kilometers, the Great Tunnel Network is the single largest engineering project in the world. It features:

- Ventilation systems that maintain breathable air throughout
- Drainage channels that prevent flooding
- Acoustic design that allows whispered conversation to carry for kilometers
- Self-maintaining structural wards (a collaboration with goblin mages)

### The Copperdeep Clock

A massive mechanical clock in the goblin city of Copperdeep that has kept perfect time for over six hundred years without any external power source. Human engineers have studied it extensively and still cannot fully explain how it works. The goblins who built it left no documentation, which the current Guild considers the ultimate flex.

### Pressure Lifts

Goblin-designed elevators that use a combination of water pressure and counterweights to move cargo and passengers between tunnel levels. Some pressure lifts can raise loads of several tons through vertical shafts hundreds of meters deep. The systems are elegant, energy-efficient, and completely silent.

## Goblin Devices in Common Use

| Device | Function | Surface Equivalent |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Drip-clock | Timekeeping via water drip rates | Water clock (but more accurate) |
| Clickspring | Mechanical fire starter | Flint and steel (but one-handed) |
| Tunnelbore | Rotating drill for excavation | No real equivalent at this scale |
| Glowjars | Bioluminescent lighting | Oil lamps (but indefinite fuel) |
| Chatterpipe | Acoustic communication tube | Speaking tube (but multi-kilometer range) |
| Springlock | Mechanical security device | Padlock (but nearly pick-proof) |

## Why Goblin Engineering Works

The secret to goblin engineering is patience and iteration. Where surface engineers tend to design on paper and build once, goblin engineers prototype relentlessly. A major project might go through dozens of physical prototypes before construction begins. The guilds maintain extensive archives of failed designs, which are studied as carefully as successful ones.

Additionally, goblins have an intuitive understanding of materials science that borders on the supernatural. A goblin Tinkerer can assess the quality of a metal sample by tapping it, smelling it, and — reportedly — licking it. This is not magic; it is simply the product of a culture that has been working with metals underground for millennia.

> "I watched a goblin engineer fix a device I'd been struggling with for weeks. She hit it twice with a hammer, bent a pipe fifteen degrees, and walked away. It worked perfectly. I have two advanced degrees." — Professor Wilhelm Dreyer, Imperial College of Engineering

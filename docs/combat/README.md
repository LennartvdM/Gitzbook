# Combat & Warfare

Goblins are not, by nature, a warlike people. They would much rather be tinkering, farming mushrooms, or arguing about stew recipes. However, thousands of years of defending their territories against larger, stronger species have made them formidable fighters when provoked.

Goblin warfare is characterized by three things:

1. **Avoidance** — The best fight is the one that never happens. Goblins invest heavily in deterrence (traps, wards, reputation) to avoid combat entirely.

2. **Asymmetry** — When fighting is unavoidable, goblins never fight fair. They use terrain, traps, ambushes, and superior knowledge of their environment to negate the size and strength advantages of their opponents.

3. **Efficiency** — Goblin military doctrine prizes achieving objectives with minimum casualties and resource expenditure. A battle that achieves its goal but wastes lives is considered a failure.

## Military Organization

Goblin military forces are organized at the clan level. Each clan maintains a **war-band** — a group of trained fighters who also serve as scouts, patrol guards, and trap-maintainers during peacetime.

War-band sizes vary by clan population:

| Clan Size | Typical War-band | Leadership |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| Under 50 | 8-12 fighters | War-captain |
| 50-150 | 15-30 fighters | War-captain + 2 lieutenants |
| 150-300 | 30-60 fighters | War-chief + war-council |
| Allied force | Varies | Elected Grand War-chief |

Inter-clan alliances for mutual defense are common and governed by formal treaties. The largest recorded allied goblin force — assembled during the Border War of 1612 CE — numbered approximately eight thousand fighters from forty-seven clans.

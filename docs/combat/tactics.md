# Battle Tactics

Goblin tactical doctrine has been refined over millennia of fighting opponents who are almost always bigger, stronger, and more numerous. The result is a sophisticated approach to warfare that frustrates conventional military thinkers.

## Fundamental Doctrine

Goblin tactics are built on four principles:

### 1. Control the Environment

Goblins fight on their terms or not at all. This means:
- Luring enemies into prepared killing zones
- Collapsing tunnels to channel enemy movement
- Using darkness, smoke, and scent to disorient
- Never engaging in open-field battle if any alternative exists

### 2. Strike and Vanish

Goblin forces rarely hold ground against a superior force. Instead, they:
- Attack from ambush, inflict casualties, and withdraw before the enemy can respond
- Use escape tunnels and bolt-holes that are too small for larger species
- Rotate fresh fighters in as others withdraw, maintaining constant pressure
- Fight in shifts; a goblin war-band can maintain harassment operations indefinitely

### 3. Make Them Pay for Every Step

Defensive goblin warfare is an exercise in attrition:
- Layered trap networks that slow and damage advancing forces
- Multiple defensive lines, each requiring effort to breach
- Strategic resource denial (poisoning water sources, collapsing supply routes)
- Psychological warfare (drums in the dark, distant laughter, sudden silence)

### 4. Know When to Abandon

Goblins will abandon territory to preserve lives. Settlements can be rebuilt; clan members cannot be replaced. Every goblin settlement has evacuation plans, and most have hidden emergency exits that only the Greybeard and war-captain know about.

## Common Tactical Formations

### The Funnel

Used in tunnel defense. Defenders retreat through progressively narrower passages, forcing attackers to thin their formation. At the narrowest point, a small group of goblin fighters can hold off a much larger force.

```
Wide tunnel entrance (enemy enters here)
    ↓
Trap zone 1 (alarm + pitfall)
    ↓
Narrowing passage (ranged fire from slots)
    ↓
Trap zone 2 (net + rockfall)
    ↓
Choke point (3 defenders hold this)
    ↓
Escape route (collapse behind you if needed)
```

### The Carousel

A harassment tactic used in larger caverns. Three or more small groups attack in rotation — as one group engages and withdraws, the next attacks from a different direction. The enemy is forced to constantly pivot, never given time to organize a coherent response.

### The False Retreat

A goblin classic. Fighters appear to flee in panic, drawing pursuers into a prepared trap zone. The "retreating" goblins know exactly where the traps are and run between them. The pursuers do not.

> "We've fallen for the false retreat four times this campaign. We know it's a trick. We fall for it anyway because the alternative is letting them escape, and the last time we let them escape they collapsed our supply tunnel." — Captain Aldric Voss, Imperial Border Guard, personal journal

### The Deep Siege

When goblins need to take a fortified position (rare, but it happens), they dig. Goblin sappers can tunnel beneath fortifications, bypass walls entirely, and emerge inside the target. This takes time, but goblins are patient.

## Psychological Warfare

Goblins excel at getting inside their opponents' heads:

- **Drums**: Rhythmic drumming from multiple directions, impossible to locate in tunnels. Continues for hours. Stops suddenly. Starts again when you're almost asleep.
- **Laughter**: Distant, echoing goblin laughter in the dark. There's never just one source.
- **Gifts**: Leaving small items (a polished stone, a mushroom, a note) in places where the enemy thought they were secure. The message: "We were here. We chose not to kill you. This time."
- **The Silence**: After days of harassment, everything suddenly stops. The waiting is often worse than the attacks.

## Rules of Engagement

Despite their ruthless tactical approach, goblin warfare has rules:

1. **No targeting younglings** — Children are off-limits, period
2. **Surrender is accepted** — A surrendering enemy is taken prisoner and ransomed
3. **Healer immunity** — Medics on both sides are not targeted (a pragmatic rule)
4. **Water rights** — Poisoning a shared water source is forbidden even in wartime
5. **The Parley flag** — A white mushroom on a stick signals a request for negotiation; attacking under parley is considered an unforgivable crime

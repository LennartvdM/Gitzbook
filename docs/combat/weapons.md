# Weapons & Armor

Goblin weapons and armor reflect their engineering philosophy: practical, efficient, and designed for fighters who are smaller than most of their opponents.

## Melee Weapons

### The Grak-blade

The standard goblin sidearm. A short, heavy-backed blade roughly 40cm long, designed for close-quarters tunnel fighting. The blade is single-edged with a curved tip optimized for slashing in confined spaces.

Grak-blades are made from *grak-tin* alloy — lighter than steel, holds a decent edge, and is easy to produce in underground forges. The green patina that develops over time is considered a sign of a well-used weapon.

### The Tunnel Pick

A dual-purpose tool/weapon. One end is a pointed pick (for rock or armor), the other is a flat hammer face (for construction or blunt strikes). Most goblin fighters carry a tunnel pick as their primary weapon because it's useful even when nobody needs stabbing.

### The Barb-staff

A longer weapon (roughly 1.5 meters) used by goblins defending wider passages. It's a wooden or metal shaft with retractable barbs near both ends. The barbs can be locked open (making it a spear) or retracted (making it a staff), switched mid-combat by a wrist mechanism.

## Ranged Weapons

### Slings

The goblin ranged weapon of choice. Cheap, silent, and devastating when used by a trained slinger at close range in a tunnel. Goblin slingers use shaped stone or metal ammunition and can achieve remarkable accuracy out to 30 meters.

### Blowguns

Favored by forest goblins, blowguns deliver poisoned darts with precision and near-total silence. The poisons used range from paralytic (for capture) to lethal (for defense), all derived from natural sources that forest goblins cultivate.

### Crossbows

Mountain goblins developed a compact crossbow that can be cocked and fired one-handed. It sacrifices range for portability and rate of fire. The bolts are typically tipped with barbed heads that are extremely difficult to remove — a deliberate design choice.

## Armor

Goblin armor prioritizes mobility over protection. A goblin in heavy plate armor is a goblin who can't run, climb, or squeeze through escape tunnels — which defeats the purpose.

### Standard Kit

- **Leather cuirass**: Hardened leather chest piece, often reinforced with *grak-tin* plates at vital points
- **Arm wraps**: Leather strips protecting the forearms (where tunnel combat injuries are most common)
- **Helm**: A simple skull cap with ear slits; goblin ears are important for spatial awareness in the dark
- **No leg armor**: Mobility is too important to sacrifice

### Specialist Armor

- **Trap-layer suit**: Heavily padded, designed to protect against accidental triggering of your own traps
- **Scout leather**: Extra-light armor treated with scent-masking compounds
- **Shield-shell**: A dome-shaped shield worn on the back, used by rear-guard fighters retreating through tunnels

## Traps

Traps deserve special mention because they are, in many ways, the goblin's primary weapon. A well-trapped tunnel can stop a force many times the size of the defending clan.

Common trap types:

- **Pitfalls**: Concealed drops into lower tunnels, sometimes with spikes, sometimes just a long fall
- **Rockfalls**: Triggered cave-ins that block passages (and anyone in them)
- **Net traps**: Spring-loaded nets that pin intruders in place
- **Alarm traps**: Non-lethal devices that alert defenders and disorient intruders (noise, flash, stink)
- **The Classic**: A pressure plate connected to a mechanism that drops a large rock on your head

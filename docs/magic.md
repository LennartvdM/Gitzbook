# Goblin Magic

Goblin magic is fundamentally different from the arcane traditions practiced by humans, elves, or dwarves. Where other magical traditions draw power from ley lines, divine sources, or innate talent, goblin magic is rooted in what they call *Grak'thuum* — roughly translated as "the stubbornness of things."

## Theoretical Foundations

Goblin magical theory holds that all objects have a natural tendency to resist change. A rock wants to stay a rock. Water wants to stay water. Goblin mages don't override this resistance — they negotiate with it.

This means goblin magic is:

- **Slow** — spells often require hours of preparation
- **Reliable** — once set, effects rarely fail or misfire
- **Material-dependent** — requires specific physical components
- **Persistent** — goblin enchantments can last centuries

```
The Three Laws of Grak'thuum:
1. Nothing changes without agreement
2. The smaller the change, the easier the agreement
3. Every agreement has a price
```

## Schools of Goblin Magic

### Wardcraft

The most common and practical school. Wardcraft involves placing protective enchantments on locations, objects, or (rarely) individuals. Goblin wards are legendary for their durability.

Common applications:
- Tunnel stability wards (preventing cave-ins)
- Alarm wards (detecting intruders)
- Preservation wards (keeping food fresh for decades)
- The infamous "embarrassment ward" (causes intruders to trip repeatedly)

### Fungimancy

Unique to goblins, fungimancy is the magical art of cultivating and communicating with fungi. Master fungimancers can:

- Accelerate mushroom growth a thousandfold
- Create bioluminescent lighting systems
- Develop mushrooms with specific medicinal properties
- Establish fungal communication networks spanning entire tunnel systems

The Fungal Telegraph — a network of magically enhanced mycelium connecting major goblin cities — allows messages to be transmitted underground faster than surface mail.

### Tinkermancy

The intersection of goblin engineering and magic. Tinkermancers create devices that shouldn't work according to conventional physics but do anyway because the goblin was too stubborn to accept that they couldn't.

Notable tinkermancy achievements:
- Self-winding clockwork with no energy source
- Lamps that produce light by "convincing" metal to glow
- The infamous Goblin Calculator, which can perform complex mathematics but only if you argue with it first

### Gloomweaving

A secretive school practiced primarily by bog goblins. Gloomweaving manipulates shadows, darkness, and the emotional associations humans have with the dark. It is not illusion magic — gloomweavers insist that shadows are real things with real properties.

Applications include:
- Creating areas of impenetrable darkness
- Hiding objects within shadows
- Shadow-stepping (short-range teleportation between shadows)
- "Bottling" darkness for later use

## Magic and Daily Life

Most goblins have no magical ability whatsoever. Roughly 1 in 200 goblins shows aptitude for Grak'thuum, and of those, only a fraction complete formal training. However, the products of goblin magic are everywhere in goblin society:

- Ward-stones protect every settlement
- Fungimancy provides lighting and food enhancement
- Tinkermancy devices are common household items
- Even non-magical goblins use minor enchanted tools daily

## Limitations

Goblin magic cannot:

- Affect living creatures directly (wards on people are temporary and uncomfortable)
- Create something from nothing
- Work quickly under pressure (goblin battle-mages are a contradiction in terms)
- Be learned by non-goblins (attempts have universally failed, possibly because non-goblins aren't stubborn enough)
